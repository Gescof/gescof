# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I consider myself passionate about new technologies in their most technical part. My area of specialization is mainly related to software development throughout its life cycle: requirements management, design and analysis, implementation, deployment and maintenance.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on micro services and documented APIs projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS serverless integration with Spring Boot apps.
